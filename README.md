# BatteryLifespan
A lightweight utility app for MacBooks (not iMac, Mac Pro, or Mac mini) that help you to maximize your battery lifespan (keep your battery capable of holding charge). This app will run in background and popup an alert in few conditions that could shorten battery lifespan:
1. Too high (> 35°C) or too low (< 10°C) operating temperature.
2. Drained down to 0% charge too many times (coming soon).
3. Not storing it half-charged for long term (coming soon).

## Download
[v2017.10-beta.1](https://github.com/arisferyanto/BatteryLifespan/releases/download/v2017.10-beta.1/BatteryLifespan.app.zip)

## Installation
Control-click the app icon, then choose Open from the shortcut menu. When it asks "“BatteryLifespan.app” is from an unidentified developer. Are you sure you want to open it?", choose Open. This is because I'm not enrolled in Apple Developer Program (haven't found a good reason to pay S$148 per year for it).
