# BatteryLifespan
A lightweight utility app for macOS that help you to maximize your battery lifespan (keep your battery capable of holding charge). This app will popup an alert in few conditions that could shorten battery lifespan:
1. Too high (> 35°C) or too low (< 10°C) operating temperature.
2. Drained down to 0% charge too many times (coming soon).
3. Not storing it half-charged for long term (coming soon).
